To collab on github, download cmder from this website: https://cmder.app/
I am using visual studio to edit but feel free to use whatever possible.

Necessary commands (cmder):
1) cd : move to the file you want
   e.g. cd C:Users/Documents or cd .. to move back
2) dir : show all files you can move to
3) git clone <link> : to download the codes into PC
4) git add .  : save all the changes
5) git commit -m "message"  : to tell other about the changes you made
6) git remote -v : check all the branch you have
7) git push origin <branch_name> : upload the changes to the website
8) git pull origin <branch_name> : download the changes from website to ur PC
9) git checkout -b <branch_name> : create a new branch

Normal procedure:
1) Go to the website repository
2) Copy the link
3) Go to the cmder type "git clone <link>"
4) Go to your coding platform
5) git checkout -b <branch_name>
5) Write your code
6) git add .
7) git commit -m "added <something>"
8) git push origin <branch_name>
